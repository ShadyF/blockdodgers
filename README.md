# blockdodgers
An exploration of training neural networks using genetic algorithms to sovle a simple game.

This project consists of mainly 3 demos. Each involve the neural network trying to solve a different variation of the same game.

The best and most clear vizualization of the neural network actually improving is in demo 3.
